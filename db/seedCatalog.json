    "description": "Aquilegia canadensis. Red Columbine's wonderful flowers appear mid-spring to early summer, with spurs at the back that are generous with nectar, luring hummingbirds, butterflies, and long tongued bees. Its distinctive red flowers dance and wobble in the slightest breeze. A hardy perennial in Zones 3 to 9, it thrives in partial shade. It can be grown in full sun, but it would benefit from even more soil moisture. The flowers are followed by decorative seed pods that dry and begin to shed their contents in late summer.",
    "timing": "Direct sow in autumn or mid-winter. Seeds can be started indoors, but it’s more complicated: Sow seeds in flats of moistened, sterilized seed starting mix, and place these inside plastic bags in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks. Then sink the flats outdoors in the ground in a shady spot, and cover with glass. As seedlings appear, transplant them or pot them on. Germination takes 30-90 days.",

Columbine’s flowers are followed by distinctive seed pods that open on their own when the seeds are ripe. These can be removed to prevent self sowing, or for very easy harvest of the seeds. We like to harvest Columbine seeds mid-summer and spread them in any shady spot that could use some colour. Grow Columbine in humus-rich, moist, but well-drained soil.",

These lovely, firm heirloom tomatoes are a culinary favourite. The deep red flesh is firm, not too juicy and the taste is a fine balance between sweet and rich. Of Amish origins circa the late 1800's, originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The plants have a long growing season and will produce bountiful yields of flavourful fruit until late fall. Vines often reach over 6 feet and will require heavy staking for support.\n\nThe shape of Amish Paste organic tomatoes varies from \"ox heart\" to \"plum\" - both may often be found on the same plant at the same time.

Indigo Rose organic tomatoes hang in clusters from vigorous sprawling vines with wild, curly leaves. Plants are hardy and have good disease resistance.\n\nAs the fruit matures the skin will become purple where exposed to light and the fruit tends to have a purple crown. This is caused by the antioxidant anthocyanin reacting to the sun.

    "description": "Darkness looseleaf lettuce seeds are a Lolla Rossa type. The incredibly dense, frilly leaves are green with deep, deep red edges. The stiff frills help to separate other leaves in salads as well as adding a lovely red colour. This variety should do well in low light conditions. Its small leaves are perfect for garnishes. Add contrast to your lettuce bed with this tasty and remarkable lettuce. For ultimate economy, try planting one seed in each cell of a 72-cell Plug Insert. Once the seedlings are ready for transplant, you can use a short piece of 1/4\" dowel (or even a pencil) to pop each lettuce out of the tray. They can then be planted at precise spacing, which does away with thinning and waste.",

Anaheim peppers are from southern California and have been cultivated since at least 1913. The tapered fruits have thick walls that are excellent for roasting or smoking and will mature to dark red if left on the plant. Much less hot than a Jalapeno at 100-500 SHUs. In a warm climate, the plants will bear continuously over a long period, with good foliage cover to protect the fruits. Anaheim makes a good, very mild substitute for Ancho in chile relleno recipes.",

Lemon cucumber seeds produce a vigorous long vine that does well on a trellis or fence. This productive variety was introduced to the US market from Australia by Samuel Wilson in 1894. Plants may become quite sprawly, but the fruit production is incredibly vigorous. Be sure to keep plants carefully picked so that no fruits are allowed to mature on the vine. This will lengthen the fruiting period.\n\nMatures in 70 days. (Open-pollinated seeds)",
    "timing": "Cucumbers need very warm soil to germinate. If direct sowing, wait until mid-June. If weather turns cool and wet after that, just re-sow. Or start transplants indoors in individual peat or coir pots 3-4 weeks before transplanting out into warm soil. If starting indoors, use bottom heat. Transplant when the plants develop their third true leaf. If the plants are too big, they may experience transplant shock. Optimal soil temperature for germination (and transplanting): 15-30°C (60-85°F).",
    "starting": "Sow 3-4 seeds 2cm (1″) deep in each spot you want a plant to grow. Thin to the strongest seedling. Space plants 23cm (9″) apart in rows 90cm (36″) apart.",
    "growing": "Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. Choose a warm, well-drained soil. Raised beds work well. Add diolomite lime and compost or well-rotted manure to the bed and ½-1 cup of complete organic fertilizer mixed into the soil beneath each transplant. Cucumbers are vigorous and need lots of nutrition and water. Use plastic mulch, plant under floating row cover or cloches – anything to warm things up. Once the weather warms up, keep soil evenly moist. When plants begin to flower, remove covers so bees can access the flowers to pollinate. Fruit that is not fully pollinated will be very small and shriveled, and should be removed from the plant. Most varieties should produce fruits until the weather begins to cool down. Keep plants well picked for better production. Try to water the soil only, keeping the leaves as dry as possible.",
    "companion_planting": "Plant cucumbers beside asparagus, beans, Brassicas, celery, corn, dill, kohlrabi, lettuce, onion, peas, radish, and tomatoes. Avoid planting near potatoes and sage. Both corn and sunflowers can act as a trellis for cucumbers to good effect. Dill will help cucumbers by attracting predatory insects, and nasturtiums is said to improve the flavour and growth of cucumbers.",

    "description": "C. maxima. Dill's Atlantic Giant pumpkin seeds hold the world record for giant pumpkins, and produce the largest fruit in the plant kingdom. Bred in eastern Canada by Howard Dill, Atlantic Giant can reach 1,000 lbs or more! The record is 2,624.6 lbs - updated for 2020! The really big ones look like big orange Volkswagen Beetles. These giants grow on very large plants, with vines up to 50' long, so they require lots of room, full sun, and fertile soil to produce the giant pumpkins. For the largest size, prepare a growing area 20 x 20 feet, and dig down three feet. Fill this with soil mixed heavily with fully composted manure and glacial rock dust. Apply a balanced organic fertilizer at transplant time, and feed the plant every two weeks with liquid kelp or fish fertilizer. Once a fruit begins to grow, remove all female flowers that follow so that there is only one fruit per plant. Consider placing a tarp or board beneath the fruit as it develops in order to shift it once it is fully grown.",
    "timing": "Direct sow or transplant in late spring once the soil is warm. For transplants, start seeds indoors during the first two weeks of May. Optimal soil temperature: 25-35°C (77-95°F). Seeds should germinate in 7-14 days.",

    "growing": "Ideal pH: 6.0-6.8. These big plants need lots of food. Choose a sunny spot with fertile, well-draining soil. Dig in a generous quantity of finished compost and/or composted manure. Dig in 1 cup of complete organic fertilizer under each plant. All pumpkins grow male flowers first, then the female flowers are produced. The female flowers have tiny fruits at the base of the petals and require pollination by bees, mostly. Incomplete pollination is common at the beginning of the season, and results in small fruits that are misshapen at the flower end. Discard these damaged fruits before they rot.",

Lacinato is often referred to as Dinosaur Kale due to its large size and distinctive, prehistoric look. It is an old descendent of Mediterranean kale. Plant Lacinato kale seeds in your organic vegetable garden and harvest this popular and nutritious super-food from summer to late fall.",

    "description": "Vibrant red tipped bunching onion that develops its colour early. Apache forms a small, vivid pink bulb if left to mature. Its mild flavour and crisp texture make this colourful variety a wonderful addition to salads and sandwiches. Provided with the frost protection of a cloche row cover, Apache will grow slowly all winter long. Sow at three-week intervals from March to the end of July for a continuous harvest. The quirky little onions are perfect for the market table. Winner of the RHS Award of Garden Merit.",
    "timing": "Start shallots and storage onions indoors in late winter and early spring, and transplant 2-4 weeks after the last frost date. Overwintering onions need to be started in early summer, and transplanted by the middle of August. Scallions can be direct sown every 3 weeks from two weeks after the last frost date to late summer. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 21-25°C (70-75°F). Seeds will emerge in 6-12 days, depending on conditions.",
    "starting": "Transplants are preferred for home gardeners. Sow 3 seeds 5mm-1cm (¼-½”) deep in each cell of a 72-cell tray. Transplant as a clump, spacing each 15cm (6″) apart in rows 45-75cm (18-30″) apart. Scallions can be spaced at 2-5cm (1-2″) apart in rows 15cm (6″) apart.",
    "growing": "Ideal pH: 5.5-6.5 (6.0-6.8 for scallions). Fertile and well-drained soil in full sun is essential. Add well-rotted compost and dig ½-1 cup balanced organic fertilizer into the soil beneath each 3m (10′) of row. Keep moisture high in the top 20-30cm (8-12″) of soil. Most of the bulb should form on the surface of the soil, so don’t transplant too deeply. Bulb size is dependent on the size of the tops: the bigger the tops, the bigger the bulb. Provide August-planted scallions with the frost protection of a cloche or heavy row cover as the first frost date approaches.",

The bicolour ears are slender, but very well filled, all the way to the tip at 20cm (8\") long. The kernels are very sweet with rich flavour and appealing texture that pops when bitten.

If it rains after planting and corn does not emerge, just re-plant the area.",

Because corn is wind pollinated, plant in a dense block of at least 4 rows, rather than in single rows. This increases the chance of corn pollen, which emerges from male flowers at the growing tip, to fall down onto the receptive female silks that extend from each corn cob.",
    "growing": "Ideal pH: 5.8-6.8. Corn is a heavy feeder, so add manure or compost, and use 500g (1 lb) of complete organic fertilizer per 6m (60′) of row, mixing it thoroughly into the soil beneath each seed furrow. Thin to at least 20-25cm (8-10″) apart in the row. Large eared and double-eared varieties need to be 30cm (24″) apart. Keep free of weeds until knee-high, and then leave it alone.

    "description": "Sweet and fresh, this picturesque basil won the AAS award for both flavour and form. After harvest, it rebounds to its previous tidy shape. The large leaves of Dolce Fresca are among the nicest Genovese basils we’ve tried. It looks fantastic in patio containers, or just growing in any well drained herb bed. Grow this basil in full sun during the warmest part of the year. Harvest regularly by pinching top-most pair of leaves from each stem. This will encourage bushy, vigorous growth lower on the plants and prolong the harvest window for each plant.",
    "timing": "Basil grows well in containers indoors at any time of year provided you can supply enough light. For outdoor growing, sow basil seeds throughout late spring for transplanting to the garden after the summer solstice. Or direct sow in early summer, once the soil has warmed up. Basil requires warm soil and full sun. Optimal temperature for germination: 21°C (70°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-10 days.",
    "starting": "Sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep in sterilized seed starting mix. Basil is prone to damping off, so once seeds sprout, make sure they are adequately ventilated, and kept under very bright light. Thin to 20-25cm (8-10″) apart. Using bottom heat speeds germination.",
    "growing": "Use any rich, loose, well drained soil. Once plants are 15cm (6″) tall, pinch out the growing tips to encourage really bushy growth prior to harvest. Watch for signs of flower buds forming in mid-summer, and pinch these off to promote more foliage.",
    "harvest": "Frequent harvesting will prolong the life of the plant. Basil leaves have the best flavour just before the plant flowers, and if you plan to preserve some of your basil or make a big batch of pesto, this is the best time to harvest. Flowering can be delayed by pinching or clipping off new flower buds.",
    "companion_planting": "Basil is said to improve vigour and flavour of tomatoes, planted side-by-side. It's also good with asparagus, oregano, and peppers. Basil helps repel flies, mosquitoes, and thrips.",

The leaves will be familiar to anyone who has grown marigolds, but the Latin species name refers to its sparse and diminutive flowers. Yet the plants can reach 2m (6') tall, so they are a striking addition to the herb garden. The roots of Peruvian Black Mint are known to kill many perennial weeds, including Ground Elder, Couch Grass, and Field Bind Weed. This herb is a staple ingredient in a number of Peruvian dishes.\n\nAnnual.",

    "description": "Large, fuzzy, cucumber-scented leaves and vivid blue flowers attract bees all summer long. Usually grown for the bees and flowers, young leaves can be cooked like spinach or used in salads. Also known as the star flower because of the arrangement of its petals, the flowers have a light cucumber flavour and will stun with their vivid blue petals. A dramatic use is to make ice cubes with the petals frozen into them and drop into cold drinks. Borage seeds contain oils with the highest concentration (20% to 30%) of the fatty acid GLA, even higher than Evening Primrose. Altogether a versatile, attractive and useful herb, add starry blue flowers to salads, drinks, berry desserts for visual appeal. Borage may self sow. It is attractive to bumblebees that must buzz at a certain resonance to release a jet of pollen.",
    "timing": "Direct sow in mid- to late spring. Borage develops a delicate taproot, so it’s best direct sown where it is to grow. Borage does not transplant well. Optimal soil temperature for germination: 21°C (70°F). Seeds should sprout in 5-15 days.",
    "starting": "Sow seeds 1cm (½”) deep, and thin to 60cm (24″) apart. Borage will get large and fill in spaces between plants.",
    "growing": "Borage is an un-fussy, self-sowing annual. To avoid self-sowing, the flower heads need to be picked regularly. Borage does best in full sun in well drained soil.",
    "harvest": "Pick fresh flowers for freezing or drying for bouquets. Cut the fresh leaves during the summer to add to salads or spreads.",
    "companion_planting": "Borage is an excellent all around companion plant. Borage deters hornworm and cabbage worms, and is particularly useful planted near tomatoes and strawberries. Very attractive to pollinators and excellent for the soil and compost. Borage is deer-proof.",
